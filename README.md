# WebRTC plugin for Flutter

[WebRTC](http://webrtc.org) is a open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. This plugin should help to integrate Flutter Android/iOS apps with WebRTC.

Currently, it's my pet project for learning Flutter and it's not production ready.
