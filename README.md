# WebRTC plugin for Flutter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shepeliev/webrtc_plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shepeliev/webrtc_plugin)

[WebRTC](http://webrtc.org) is an open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. This plugin should help to integrate Flutter Android/iOS apps with WebRTC.

Currently, it's my pet project for learning Flutter and it's not production ready.
